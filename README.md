# Health Tracker

## Resource for Healthy Lifestyle

This project is a calorie tracker that tracks the amount of calories you gain from food and the amount of calories you lose based on a variety of factors, including exercise and day-to-day walking. This application is open to all types of users. Those interested in understanding their daily calorie intake or wanting to live a healthier livestyle should definitely try this application. Others who have been going to the gym or meal prepping can also use this to track their calories. Users will be able to:
- Set goals for **daily** calorie intake and loss (calorie deficit) 
- Add **food items** to calculate the total amount of calorie intake 
- Add **exercises** done to calculate total calorie burned throughout the day
- Find the **difference** between the *calorie intake and loss*, and see if the goal has been *met*
- Keep track of the **food groups** eaten from

An active, healthy lifestyle can help individuals lead to an maximum performance and an optimal life. Counting calories is something extremely overlooked by the general population but important in our society today. As an athlete myself, I understand performance not only on the court but at a workplace or school can depend on our diet and activity. I strongly believe a health tracker like this can help people set goals and achieve them. The goal of this project is for people to start caring for their calorie intake and find ways to achieve their optimal lifestyle.
